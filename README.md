# kernel-cve-tool

A tool for reviewing downstream Linux kernel repositories for CVE patches.

## Setup

1. Clone the git repository with your Linux kernel and checkout the branch
   you want to review. For example:
   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/madisongh/linux-tegra-4.9.git -b patches-l4t-r32.3.1
   ```
2. Add linux-stable as a git remote and fetch it:
   ```
   $ git remote add stable git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git
   $ git fetch stable
   ```
3. In a different directory, clone the linux_kernel_cves repository:
   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/nluedtke/linux_kernel_cves.git
   ```
4. `cd` to where you checked out your kernel repo and run `kernel-cve-tool`:
   ```
   $ kernel-cve-tool -P /path/to/linux_kernel_cves
   ```

The upstream stable kernel repo is needed for locating commits for fixes that may
not be present in your local repository. The linux_kernel_cves repository is a
data set that maps CVEs to upstream kernel commits.

## Execution
The script parses the top-level makefile to determine the base kernel version,
parses the JSON data files in linux_kernel_cves, and builds a list of CVEs to
look for.

Initially:
* CVEs listed as fixed in versions earlier than the current SUBLEVEL are assumed to be present.
* CVEs fixed in versions after the current SUBLEVEL or listed in the data set as 'outstanding'
  are assumed to be unfixed.
 
 The script then searches for commits that contain either the git hash corresponding to
 the reported fix (if present in the data set) for each of the CVEs in the 'unfixed' list,
 and/or the exact subject line for the fix commit. If found in the current branch,
 the CVE is moved to the 'fixed' list.
 
 Note that this processing can take several minutes.
 
 When the scan is complete, two files are created in the current directory:
 * `PATCHED-CVES`: lists the CVEs in the 'fixed' list
 * `cherry-picks.list`: lists the git hashes for manual cherry-picking with:
    ```
    $ cut -d: -f1 cherry-picks.list | git cherry-pick -x --stdin  
    ```
